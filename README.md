# verification-hook
Webhook used to send notification to Discord upon completion of Google Form

## Installation

Basically, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/Iku/Google-Forms-to-Discord

If you couldn't find the script editor for the Google Form, you have to enable the linked spreadsheet to the google form and add the script there. Then, carry on with the guide as normal.
